## Description

Structural Disks adds new structural parts based off the structural panels already in the game. 

Instead, these panels (or disks) are circular and come in 0.625m, 1.25m, 2.5m and 3.75m diameters.

Each disk also has multiple textures to choose from, thanks to Interstellar Fuel Switch.
